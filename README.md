Its the first of its kind **Open Source** event to be held at the IIEST campus. It is based on reverse coding.


`Given some inputs and outputs you will have to figure out the logic behind it.`
  
It will be a 90 - Minute challenge and top participants will get exiting prizes and a `certificate of appreciation`.

The event will be held on Github. So, it is mandatory for all participants to have a github account.

Once you have created your account with your username, you are ready to participate!

## Problems
There will be four (4) problems:

* Problem 1
* Problem 2
* Problem 3
* Problem 4

For each problem you need to submit your solution in any language you want (preferrably C/ C++/ Java/ Python/ Ruby/ R)

## Submission Guidelines

In order to submit you solutions, simply create a folder having folder name of your github username and within that folder, submit your solutions for the problems.

-----------------------------------------------

For example,

* create folder under submission folder like this `submission/prateekiiest`
* under this new folder create  folder for the problem you are solving and its solution file - like `submission/prateekiiest/problem-1/output`
